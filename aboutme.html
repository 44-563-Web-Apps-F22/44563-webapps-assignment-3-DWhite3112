<p>I was born in LasVegas, Nevada, but grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. 
    I write with my left hand, but prefer using my right hand while playing sports. 
    Video games are my second favorite hobby outside of sport activities.

    <h1>Troy</h1>
    
    <p>Troy is an amazing movie covering a historic eventof the battle of Troy.
        I like it because it has a variety of different genres within in, like action, drama, tragic love, and some comical aspects.
        It's a movie that you can watch more than once and enjoy it each time.
