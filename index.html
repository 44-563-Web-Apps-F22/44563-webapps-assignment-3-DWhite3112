    <h1>DeAndre' White</h1>
    <h2>Nelson Atkins</h2>
    <p><b>The Nelson Atkins Museum</b> has a vast collection of art pieces. The <b>Japanese</b> collection really draws my eyes to it. 
        My favorite piece in this collection being the <b>Striding Lion: Mount for the Buddhist Deity Monju, Mid-13th century. Japanese.</b>
        The design of the lion has a strong and intimidating aura to it, that's what I think makes it a great piece.
